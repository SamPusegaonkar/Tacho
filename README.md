# TachoMeter

**The above code is written in Arduino C Language.**

**Description**: A tachometer is a device used to measure the rpm of a motor or any other rotating machine. The lack of a tachometer on my bike was the inspiration for this project.   <br/>
  
  **Apparatus**:     
  
    1. A microcontroller
    2. Multi-colored RGB LED
    3. IR sensor
    4. Some white tape
    5. Cardboard
                     
  **Instructions**: 
  
    1. Cut a circle on a piece of cardboard and attach some white tape from the radius of the circle to its end.
    2. Attach this circle on the shaft of the motor.
    3. Place in infrared sensor near the circle such that the tape passes atleast once, when the motor shaft rotates.
    4. I suck at explaning, so watch the video provided in the repo.
    

  **Multi-Colored RGB LED as output**:
  
    * if 0-10   rpm: then white 
    * if 10-20  rpm: then pink 
    * if 20-30  rpm: then red
    * if 30-40  rpm: then orange
    * if 40-50  rpm: then yellow
    * if 50-60  rpm: then blue
    * if 60-70  rpm: then indigo 
    * if 70-80  rpm: then green
    * if 80-90  rpm: then brown
    * if 90-100 rpm: then light blue
